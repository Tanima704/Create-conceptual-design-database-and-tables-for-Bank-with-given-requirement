# Create-conceptual-design-database-and-tables-for-Bank-with-given-requirement
An enhanced entity–relationship E(E)R diagram was drawn accurately to represent the defined set of business rules requirements of Bank Project. A relational schema from an enhanced E(E)R diagram was created. This was the conceptual design. Databases and tables were created using the conceptual design. Appropriate naming conventions were used for all tables, attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys. Relevant data was inserted in all the tables. Data was deleted and updated from each table. SQL queries were executed to fetch data with different criteria. Website was created with 4 functionalities establishing connection between application and database. The relations were normalized, and necessary testing was done.
